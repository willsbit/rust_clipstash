# Clipstash
Clipstash project, coded in rust using the Rocket.rs framework.

To run locally, clone this repository and run `cargo run --bin httpd --release`. To generate docs, one can use `cargo docs --open --no-deps`.

The site is currently hosted at render.com, using a Postgres database as storage. [Click here](https://clipstash-x0uw.onrender.com/) to go to the clipstash!
Just don't abuse the clips and API key generation, as the free tier is limited both CPU and DB-wise.
